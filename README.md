This is a fully functional Fiuu Android payment module. It can be seamlessly integrated into Android Studio as a MOLPayXDK module using Gradle integration from the JCenter/Maven repository. For reference, we’ve included an example application project called fiuuxdkproject, which demonstrates the integration with the MOLPayXDK framework.
